                <p>This extension lets you view people's interactions on Venmo to discover which users are spending money together, when they're spending money together, and what they're spending money on. Read about <a class="page-scroll" href="#about">finding</a> and <a class="page-scroll" href="#services">following</a> a user's money trail or go ahead and <a href="https://venmo.com/#yours">open it</a> to see how far the trail can lead you...</p>

                    <h1>How do I Find The Money Trail?</h1>
                </div>
                <p>The Money Trail consists of a bubble graph showing which people a user interacts the most with on Venmo, and a chart showing when the user interacts with them.</p><div class="side-by-side"><img class="side" src="../icons/bubble_closeup.png"> <img class="side" src="../icons/chart_closeup.png"></div>
                <p>To have the Trail appear you must be logged into Venmo with this the extension enabled. If the extension is running you should see a tool bar appear at the top of <a href="https://venmo.com/">venmo.com</a></p><img src="../icons/bar.png">
                <p>To view a users' Money Trail, regardless of whether you are friends with them or not, simply navigate to their Venmo profile page and select their Feed. The bubble graph should load in by default above the tool bar if the user has any data in their Feed.</p><img src="../icons/feed.png">
                <p>Keep in mind the amount of data in a user's Trail is limited by the amount of data in their Feed. To view your own Trail go to <a href="https://venmo.com/#yours">https://venmo.com/#yours</a></p>

                    <h1>How Do I Use The Money Trail?</h1>
                </div>
                <p> The two vizualizations in the Trail are good for determining the timing, content and frequency of transactions on Venmo. You can switch between these vizualizations by hitting the "Bubble Graph" or the "Transaction Chart" buttons in the tool bar.</p><img src="../icons/bubble_graph.png">
                <p>You can chnage the Trail to show only transactions that happened between two given dates by setting that date range in the tool bar.</p>
                <img src="../icons/date.png">
                <p>In the bubble graph the size of a circle corresponds to the number of Venmo transactions with that user (which can be seen by hovering over the circle).
                <img src="../icons/bubble_hover.png">
                <p>The size of the link connecting to that circle to the user corresponds to the number of times the user paid or was paid by that current user (the <span class="green">green</span> links correspond to payments to the current user, and <span class="red">red</span> links are payment from the current user). This can also be seen by hovering over the links.</p>
                <img src="../icons/link_hover.png">
                <p>In the chart every user the current user interacted with is displayed as a series. Interactions with each user are aggregated for every time range on the bottom axis and are displayed as a set of points in that user's series. Clicking a point brings up a scrollable popup box showing all the transactions with that user in that time range, along with the corresponding messages and times (<span class="green">$+</span> indicates a payment to the current user and <span class="red">$-</span> indicates a payment from the current user).</p><img src="../icons/popup.png">
                <p>Clicking the select all button in the tool bar will activate all series on the chart and clicking the deselect all button will deactivate all series on the chart (if there are a lot of series these actions could take a while to complete so please be patient).</p>
                <img src="../icons/chart.png">
                <p>Note that nither visualization can tell how much money was exchanged. Only who paid whom</p>

                <p>This extension was developed as a demonstration of how much data Venmo defaults users into sharing. It is not meant to be used as a tool to creep on people, hence this app is not optimized to gather or display large amounts of data on users. Read <a href="#">this Medium post</a> for more a detailed discussion about what motivated the creation of this extension as well as what the implications of this project are.</p>
